## Conclusion

I tried to keep this test as simple as possible, but since this is a backend engineering test, I decided to include some things:

```
Deep Logging (slog.Logger) - Helps track API calls and submissions.
Use of Locks (sync.Mutex) - Ensures concurrency safety if scaling concurrent users.
Graceful Shutdown - Handles termination signals properly.
